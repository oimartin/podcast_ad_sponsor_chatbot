I mean, what else happened something else happened? You may want to ask Johnny gaudreau has been terrible you want to ask you is that why best defenseman this season I said this season right? You just need your body best defenseman this season. I mean we've had Giordano has been hurt Monahan and drove not open them right there regular selves. It's like we've overcome so  Shit this year and we've come through it relatively. Okay, I'm fully back in love with this team. It helps that the Pacific Division is probably the weeks division of definitely helps definitely helps. Well, it's so funny because you texted me something to somebody to the other day. It's like Oilers fans right now or like the Oilers have 80 points there Stanley Cup contenders, but the Flames have 77 points morning make the playoffs make the playoffs and crazily enough if  if you check the standings as of right now, the Minnesota goddamn wild are in a playoff spot. Yeah, it's insane. Well, you saw it coming probably three weeks ago. They want a bit of a heater. They got themselves back in the race and they had game they've had games in hand. You saw it coming. I like the wild. I've always liked the Wild and I'd I said they make the laughs. I still I still think they didn't have a tough time of it. Like so only in by one point Vancouver's got a game in hand. So you think they will make it they they seem to be trending in surging right now.  I mean, they're still like 15 14 games left. The thing is is like I don't know man. They're the same position as Carrie where it's like it's their spot to lose. Yeah. We used to play a good hockey from here on in when a handful of games. I would say it would be it would be like Bizarro world if Edmonton Calgary Minnesota Vancouver made the playoffs in Nashville Winnipeg didn't but it's it looks like that's probably yeah, but it's gonna happen just not because natural is starting to fall back now Winnipeg starting to fall back now, I don't think these guys can keep pace.  Dude, it's good. I'm glad you know what Nashville needs to miss the playoffs because they need to learn a lesson about doing dumb shit, like signing mattress into a huge contract UK Subban. Yeah, and then of course, there's the Arizona Coyotes in the mix as well. The last team there tonight. We'll be telling if like a winning a regulation win against Arizona tonight.  Pretty much puts enough separation between you and them that things are looking good. Yeah, I would agree.  All right, let's talk about that game. That's a good because it was a weird game. Let's go back to this hypothesizing.  Because you and I have been right about a lot of things this season.  Things that we've been wrong about are like small things we can write about a lot of cool things. We write a lot of a big thanks. Yeah, one of them this prediction of the team will balance themselves out in the second half namely Bonnie and Johnny will research will see them turn things around Johnny has been our best player last what 10 12 games. Oh 100% he's been great. It's been great. He's back like one totally back.  I mean he still he still leads the team in scoring as far as I as far as I know right like I think he still is at the top and point. He's in point per game for the last 25 games when Holmes got the most goals.  but I know I know people are like  how many points did he have? He's got 50 seized almost got 60. I think he's got 57 points.  That's pretty that's pretty on like it's going to be so he's gonna be on the lower end of his career. He's probably on Pace for what 70s probably gonna get 65 70 points, which is still running our pizza career average, but he may just search they see him serger.  Anyways, the point I wanted to make is that we were talking about this last week.  Going into this home stretch.  Because the tail of the season so far as you've been excellent on the road do we have the best home record there were certain records or the best away record. He definitely won't resist the third best. Yeah. I know. It's the best record since January something like that. It's probably a third best on the road or 2014 and three so it's not quite as good as you might think. It's actually the exact same away record is the Oilers at home and you know, what's weird. We're not even as bad at home as I would have thought 1512 and for on home ICE 2014 and three away from the you  Is that Third Way for tonight the third quarter of the Season we want we lost like five in a row. Yeah, so it's not like we haven't been good on home ice for sure, but it's not like we've been Dreadful so it's funny how those narratives kind of get going. Right? It's like all they've been so good away from the saddledome. It's like they've won five more games, but they've also lost two more games away. Yep, so, but I bet you if you look at  You know being the best road team since January whatever it is. Yeah, you compare their home record to that time. Then you really see that? Well, I think the staff that is like the most mind-boggling. He's like David Riddick hasn't won a whole night's game since December 12. Yeah, like holy shit. Yeah, that's mind-blowing and mind you there's like how many starts is he got and there was the break? Yeah, etcetera Etc. So it is a little inflated but still like holy shit. He doesn't want a home game in 2020. It's just not so  Bring it back last week, right? The story was K. You got 11 of your last 15 games at home. Therefore. You should be good shape. However, they've been so dog shit at home. Maybe was better for put on the road.  But much to my hypothesis of they're going to turn it around the second half money Johnny you're going to like what I said last week is that they're going to turn it around here at home in these last we have 10 games now.  And they're going to be good going into the playoffs.  Now I also talked about this. Remember we were doing the pregame liar and that we should do in the pregame of life or Columbus. Yeah, and I said look this always happens. I don't mean the dog carry you right now, but don't carry me Don Cherry anything you to me.  Collier some some reason  The main thing is the first home game coming off those road trips are usually tough. Use you you happy. It's like you it's so easy to lay a stinker. Yeah, right. And so I'm alive I was like all they gotta do is keep their feet going throughout the first period try not to go down more than one goal. If you can you know that you're not going to be able to keep your legs against against them in the first period just because of the whole long road trip yada yada thing.  And so if you can stay within Arm's Reach by the second period you get legs going you're probably the better team halfway through the game by the third period you should be able to force your will upon the game. It didn't necessarily play out exactly like that. But similarly similarly. Yeah, and I think the biggest the biggest thing is like when you're trying to turn a tide of momentum.  Because just like in every game it's all about momentum shifts and momentum swings and I always talked about this how when you're getting hemmed in your own and hemmed in your own and hemmed in your own end. This team seems to be unable to break that momentum that the other team is generating you. This is what I'm saying is typically when you do it, it's a giant hit.  Even after you have to put yourself out of position momentarily it's worth it to break that momentum swing but we haven't really seen that. So just like how there's a micro momentum swings in games. There's macro momentum swings jury out this throughout the season.  So right now you have your trying to break a negative momentum.  Swing of like losing at home stinking at home. And in order to do that. It's always it never just happens. It's always like you have to push through the toughest points. There's a threshold you have to get over a hump.  That was what we saw.  Against Columbus. Yeah, they did it. It totally did it because they were down to nothing everybody that has a Stockholm Syndrome from this following this season all year lie. I know I turned it off. I had stuff to do mentally checked out quit like fuck this fuck these guys abusive relationship yada yada.  But they hung in there. They made it 2-1 Mangia Pawnee Toulon home on you Pawnee putting that that play starts with him how much how many plays in the year? She is ferocious. He is ferocious. Excellent. Did you see you see that? He's getting some accolades. Yeah Dimitri filipowicz wrote a little article about him today ESPN. Yep, getting the credit. He deserves man getting the credit. He deserves you make it 2-1 now all of a sudden.  Was it nine minutes left? 90 minutes nine. Oh nine days, nine minutes left and everybody's like well, let's see what happens.  Yeah, because if you want like if you're like me and you turn it off, I turned it back on again. So want to say so I'll Lindholm scored you watch them and I was like, I think they're going to tie it up here because they were pressing. They're playing good hockey.  Fisher shit did Matthew tkachuk Big Goal Matthew Cooke clutch to clutch. I can't say that what a beautiful goal. And by the way, thanks again this time Kelly Rudy. Thanks a lot ruining it Kelly Rudy. Why are they so obsessed that we chip that were all friends key and when offer it's like it's like, okay. Does anybody remember the well, does anybody remember everyone remembers the Jordan a pearly Team Canada World Junior goal and it's like Gord Miller called a lifetime. He's  Jordan a police cars, can you believe it and you just let that moment play if you're if you're good broadcaster, but fucking beer McGuire no has to shit over the moment. So Gord Miller everybody knows this this this happens everybody scores the tying goal. I think it was like, oh eight or o9 with like five seconds left versus the Russians Gord Miller is like joy that like a scars. Can you believe it and you're supposed to let that let it play.  And like purifiers like I'm trying to ruin the moment broadcasting color 101 let the moment play Kelly Rudy. I don't give a shit if that hit werenski. Let the moment Play My Guy when Rick balls his Matthew Chuck scores to tie the game. Let it play.  Cassie Campbell and my family's coordinated and goal this plan play out, especially when you're not even sure exactly this one's coming back. This one's coming back definitely chores. This one's coming back. This one's coming back hit they hit the glove Wicked elevator went off a player on the bench trick play anyways, so we're still have to point that out Rudy. What are you looking at? I don't know what he's looking at. If you're looking at just physics alone for one ski tip that it's not going to go well.  It went so well, so if you're looking at how could chuck reacted and then that's the other thing watch how check your racks watch out renske reacts did rescue did renske hang his head a bit lookup and disbelief. I call fuck. I tipped in my own net. No did Chucky go fucking bananas? Ballistic? Like he just fucking square an unreal Taco the tie up the game. Yes. Why do we have to give these broadcasters tips on broadcasting?  anyways  And then over time like I mean that's classic that that that is Calgary Flames see and and this is like when you try to move this whole microcosm thing of like you need to turn the tide, this is just it's a carbon copy of life. You're not get any fucking handouts. I don't know if you if anybody hasn't recognized this yet, but you're getting a goddamn hand out taking me like 10 years. I've completely wasted half of my life. But now I know we've been waiting for a handout. Yeah.  So in order to turn the tide like it takes mental fortitude.  And that game had it for me at least totally. Well because not only do you tie it up you put yourself in the position to win now to me that's like they're at the summit now and they need to do the final push to where we get over the hump down to the other side.  And we sure as shit solid overtime need me totally what an entertaining over time. What a great over time. And I mean what a great shift like, I know Brody scored the goal what I mean, we're lent. Let's work by Castro and Monahan on that goal. If you're like Relentless good rose work behind the net there, dude. He's like like not only he's okay obviously Shifty as fuck but he's outsized. I would strength hope man. There's two guys there help man. It's comes out from behind the know. How did she  Monahan not bury that dude. I thought that was in the light guy thought I was into. Oh really great save by corporate sellout or Purcell has he was hell, he was great. He had an excellent call. Yeah, he was there was also something of interest to we talked about son alive yesterday, and he missed it. But Chuck you in Corpus al-ghazali got into it a bit at a both the 11-minute mark 2 minutes ago before Lindholm tied it or scored the first goal.  I don't know. My dad had a fabric of the game and I had a Mite had a factor because here's the thing and I wasn't even really scared about Corpus a low. I just kind of knew we'd get to him because he's not skorpa Salomon. He's good, but he's on proprofs key, even though Borowski sucks. He's not Marc-Andre flurry. He's not Carter heart. It's not Carey Price. Yeah wear it when he's on top of the game like that. He can maintain it total like you just good to just tell.  So then over time your boy my boy. I'm shocked. I hate that anything you want in actually it first. I'm shocked a he got a shot through be that he hit the net. Yeah. I thought a miss and see that he got a pass the goaltender like I I'm still floored. What is going on Euro? TJ's got goals is TJ possessed. No, it was it's funny because what you and I are noticing is a trend when we start bashing players publicly on Save.  They we are never Batcher. I never rip Brody. We were hardcore ripping backlands. Yeah, we are ripping them all season and we went real hardcore like a week before he broke out. Yeah, and then it seems like every time I go out of my way, even though I always rip on Michaels own. It's like this seems the times that I specifically go out of my way to show how much he doesn't belong in the NHL. He liked scores somehow.  It's funny. And you were ragging on Brody. Well all I did all I said was I wonder if he started aiming for shin pads. He'd get it through through guys. Anyways, like a real that's pretty good. That's he does sucky any shots through like there's no denying then he scored week and then he scored two goals. So I'm young. But I mean a great play by Joe Biden Joe there because he tried that sharp angle shot that he tries all the time, which was closely on his clothes, but then he retrieved the puck to yeah, he shot it got it back we go this way out got him on hand and he didn't mind like mine.  Did cobras hello kind of had that Monahan was a dog on a bone. He was a dog on a motherfucking bone right there.  And then great job by Monty and then Brody buries it and I mean, that's what I didn't understand like we've said this few times but sometimes like the when fans and like people on the fan I'd 60 and people are like so critical of the team. It's kind of confusing to me. It's like because I on the fan especially and then I think some fans. I don't know a lot of people are like, oh that was a terrible game. They're so lucky to win that game. Well, we talked about this building alive yesterday. Yeah and  You know what reference that I use.  It comes back to this whole thing of like.  When you're trailing things always seem worse than they are. It's skewed. Yeah, the game is skewed your mindset skewed it's like when you're down to nothing and control tries to make a move or Chuckles between his legs are like you can idiot. What are you doing? I hate you never try that again. Fuck sports are funny and all right, so  But not only that you have had to deal with this whole abusive relationship is toxic relationship with this team. We've had all year of these ups and downs ups and downs and the Downs man those games were they like they don't even show up and so even Elliott Freeman in the first intermission was like he was sitting there. He was shocked. I think I said to you I'm like, all right. I don't know I said to somebody I was shocked the first 10 times. I've seen this out of this team. I'm just used to it by now, but I did have a different feeling.  I even texted you. I'm like, they're coming back. Yeah, like again like I don't understand like it's funny to me that like so many people were like mad about like this game and the Nashville game they're like, how could you blow that natural him? It's like we played incredibly well in the naturally we dominate we didn't we played we pretty much dominated the Blue Jackets for 45 minutes.  Like we'll try them 3722.  We got more High danger chances of them. We own possession like Johnny and Monty and went home were like over 90% possession don't know what else what and he came back from like a to nothing hole to win a big game. Well, I don't work. How can you really ask for much more? The thing is this is am is just kind of odd to me. The thing is is when you've been burnt so many times. Yeah, I guess you feel like you're going to get burned again. So you gotta help but you can't help it look at the game through a different set of eyes.  It's just like when I look at that game, like you said it was more encouraging that game. Like I think a lot of people are like who they bought they played an NHL team like not was having a fit on the morning show boy HL team and they barely beat them. It's like I thought there was a huge I thought they played great in battle back and it was a it was a momentum building encouraging win for me anyways, so, yeah. I don't know they do have a lot of injuries, but but they still play that John.  On Tortorella, like Mucky drag you down in the mud style. And the thing is is they got great goal tending their defense still put it's not like all their guys got hurt exact same time. And these guys are just getting called up now. Yeah, and it's all the guys that are that are filling in the holes from the AHL team. They've been playing a lot of NHL games this season. It's like there's no easy out unless this troit this team.  Which is a makeup of a lot of a gel players has got them into a playoff spot exactly. This length is hit it right. So I don't buy the Orton age whole roster the Flames barely beat them thought the Flames had a rough first and bet again like it's so funny. Like if if this game had been at a last season would have been like, oh wow the Flames they always stick with it and come back with it come with it, but it's like the fact that we've just we've seen them under perform a bit this year when they do have a strong performance in battle back were like we have this weird bias, but Olie,  Barely one and lucky to win. It was like wasn't really the case. So I think what was it in the second like I mean for call this has more points than we do for Christ's sake in the first intermission. I had I was still you really believe we're gonna win. I really I was like all they gotta do is do this and they have to do it like they they're yeah, they're backed up against the wall. I think the reason why I said to you there come on back. I just kind of had a feeling because what other choice do they have the your this  Late in the season with where the standings are the way they are. You don't have it. You don't have the choice to not come back. Yeah, so it's like it's either they don't come back or that's kind of it. Like we're kind of down here exactly. Right and what I thought was only because coming back to this whole like they need to turn the tide on home ice because if they didn't come back in that game and turn that tide, maybe they don't turn the tide at all on home ICE. Yeah and their Seasons done. So it's kind of like their backs up against the wall. It's like Sun Tzu's Art of War.  When you deliver your soldiers?  Onto the front of wherever the battle is going to take place you burn the ships behind them. So they know there's no way they're not going home.  The love it love it. And I mean I also thought it was pretty interesting that  your five top performers by game score and probably your best players on the night where your best players the Top Line in Lindholm. We'd roam on hand while Matt you posted that thing and on it like that was their great ridiculous are there or 90% core seat and expected goals. How often you see that very rare like for anybody. I'm like no one and then Geo induction line, maybe yeah seriously and then G on Brody's your best players are your best players and I think that was a for me at least anyways.  The that was a huge win for me because it kind of has got me back on track with this team. Let's do something interesting. Let's go further into that because we talked about this we're trending in the right direction. We're starting to hopefully surge here.  But if you look at all the things that aren't going wrong anymore and it also look at all things that are going right.  I mean the biggest kind of only question mark you still have is your defense tight enough because ends and goaltending there's still a bit of a question mark with with forward and Gustafson. Yeah, but yeah, how are they how are their numbers last on the first home game?  First home game. I think they're the four rows. Okay, I don't have it in front of me. But for it was fun. I think Gus got exposed a little bit. Okay, which I think if you just were watching I think that's kind that kind of chose.\""
